		controls the movement of conveyors through a mobile app, so mechanical engineers have an easier
		time when commissioning conveyor installation quality (specifically when they are looking if the
		conveyor runs smoothly).</p> <p class="svelte-1f6e0t9">I made my own PCB, added in a <span class="text-secondary">WEMOS D1 Mini development board</span> with an <span class="text-secondary">ESP8266 microcontroller</span> unit, wired everything with relays so I am able to switch the control panel inputs to the frequency
		drive and I created the app through which it can all be controlled thanks to a shared WiFi hotspot
		that all the devices are connected to.</p> <p class="svelte-1f6e0t9">A cool thing about this project is that <span class="text-secondary">the mobile app not only enables me to control the conveyor</span>, but it can have all the instructions for setup and troubleshooting the device and parts of
		the system. And since it's on mobile you do not need any additional devices :D.</p> <p class="svelte-1f6e0t9">This was a really interesting challenge with lots of different systems that intertwine into each
		other and it was <span class="text-secondary">my hardest challenge where I was solving the most issues :D.</span></p></div>`,1);function I(o,i){c(i,!1);let t=b.find(e=>e.demoLink.split("/").pop()===u.url.pathname.split("/").pop());g();var s=x(),a=h(s);f(a,()=>t,e=>{w(e,{project:t,insideProject:!0})});var n=d(a,2);v(n,"src",`${y??""}/images/projects/ConveyorController_Physical.png`),m(14),r(o,s),p()}export{I as component};
