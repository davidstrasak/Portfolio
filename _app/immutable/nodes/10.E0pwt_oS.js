		controls the movement of conveyors through a mobile app, so mechanical engineers have an easier
		time when commissioning conveyor installation quality (specifically when they are looking if the
		conveyor runs smoothly).</p> <p class="svelte-1phacfb">I made my own PCB, added in a <span class="text-secondary">WEMOS D1 Mini development board</span> with an <span class="text-secondary">ESP8266 microcontroller</span> unit, wired everything with relays so I am able to switch the control panel inputs to the frequency
		drive and I created the app through which it can all be controlled thanks to a shared WiFi hotspot
		that all the devices are connected to.</p> <p class="svelte-1phacfb">A cool thing about this project is that <span class="text-secondary">the mobile app not only enables me to control the conveyor</span>, but it can have all the instructions for setup and troubleshooting the device and parts of
		the system. And since it's on mobile you do not need any additional devices :D.</p> <p class="svelte-1phacfb">This was a really interesting challenge with lots of different systems that intertwine into each
