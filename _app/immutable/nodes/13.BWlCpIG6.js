		is to have the quadcopter in a mode where the angles are really small (because then we can say

		regulating the thrust and calculating the required angles from the x and y axis differences.</p> <p class="svelte-1phacfb"><span class="text-secondary">It was a really interesting challenge that made things click for me in terms of real
