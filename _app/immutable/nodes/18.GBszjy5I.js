It allows you to follow a structure to have websites that are
		reactive.</p> <p>I personally love SvelteKit, because it is intuitive and it does not require a lot of hoops to
		jump through. Things just make sense!</p> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl">Alright. How to do it?</h2> <p>First of all we'll need to initialise a SvelteKit project. That can be done through <span>Node.js and npm</span>. First you will need to <span>use Vite to create a project with some name</span>. Then change
		directory there and run npm install and npm run dev. <span>That will start a server that you can see inside your browser.</span></p> <!> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl">Now install the static adaper for SvelteKit</h2> <p>That can be done easily by using npm again.</p> <!> <p>This package allows you to translate SvelteKit syntax to normal HTML, JS and CSS, which let's
		you host this SvelteKit website on GitHub pages.</p> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl">Now add it to svelte.config.js</h2> <p>Just add the extra lines into the default <span>svelte.config.js.</span></p> <!> <p>Yay! Now you have a static website.</p> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl">Setting the base URL</h2> <p>Now that you have a static website, you can host it on GitHub pages. <span>But beware</span>,
		GitHub pages multi page websites do not work as the normal ones.</p> <p>Instead you will need to set a start of the URL that is the <span>same as your GitHub repository name.</span></p> <p>For example the default URL of this portfolio is <span>davidstrasak.github.io/Porfolio</span>.
		"/Portfolio" is something I had to set into a variable and use in every anchor tag on this
		website.</p> <p>This is <span>how you set the svelte.config.js</span></p> <!> <p>And this is how you use the <span></span> in every anchor tag.</p> <!> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl">Final step to make this site hosteable:</h2> <p>Just add a <span>.nojekyll</span>file into the static folder of your project.</p> <p>This file tells GitHub pages to not try to generate a static site from this repository. Because
		generating is handled by us.</p> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl"><span class="text-accent">Life hack 1:</span>Hosting on GitHub pages automatically</h2> <p>The page that we have now would have to be manually built (translated from svelte to HTML, JS
		and CSS) and uploaded to github pages.</p> <p>But that's unneccesary work!</p> <p>Instead let's use the "gh-pages" package to upload our built file onto github pages and set up
		the hosting for us.</p> <p>First install the package.</p> <!> <p>Now add these scripts into your <span>package.json</span> file.</p> <!> <p>So now you can call these scripts through typing "npm run deploy".</p> <!> <br> <p>Or if you want to <span>add to git, push to a remote github repository, build the website AND host on github pages</span>, this is the code I run when I update my site.</p> <!> <p>The positive is that you need to <span>write only one line - "npm run git" to do all the things</span> I would want to do every time. That's like <span>saving three lines of code every time</span>!</p> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl"><span class="text-accent">Life hack 2:</span>Add this site to a custom domain</h2> <p>My website's domain is not <span>davidstrasak.github.io/Porfolio</span>, but rather <span>davidstrasak.net</span>.</p> <p>I do not want to go into all the topics that go through adding a custom domain to a page hosted
		on GitHub pages, but I want to show <span>how can you automatically add the custom domain when using gh-pages</span>.</p> <p>You see, if you try to use gh-pages with a custom domain, your custom domain will be reset at
		every upload of the server.</p> <p>That is because the custom domain is stored inside a file in the build folder. <span>This file is called CNAME</span>.</p> <p>So I figured out that if I create this CNAME file inside the build folder every time after
		building the page, the custom URL will be set automatically. <span>That can be done through this line</span>.</p> <!> <p>This code is all you'll need to automate that last annoying step of adding the custom URL of the
		website into GitHub pages.</p> <br> <h2 class="text-secondary mt-4 text-3xl">If you've read this so far, you can now go and create a website that you can call your own!
