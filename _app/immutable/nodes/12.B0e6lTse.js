		when possible.</p> <p class="svelte-ox2i4o">The final project of this course was <span class="text-secondary font-bold">creating 5 tasks:</span></p> <ul class="ml-10 svelte-ox2i4o"><li>UART - the processor takes an input and sends it back reversed</li> <li>PWM - increment the brightness of an LED</li> <li>ADC - display the values of the two potentiometers</li> <li>DAC - generate three signals that I can display on an osciloscope on the PC</li> <li>GAME - program a game where you try to match a random number with the potentiometer value</li> <li class="text-secondary">Menu - program an interface and navigation so that I can switch through the tasks</li></ul> <p class="svelte-ox2i4o">This was probably the biggest coding project I have done in regards to <span class="text-secondary">tracking state inside a project</span>.
