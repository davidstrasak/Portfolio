Creating this involved making
		my own circuit on a perfboard, 3D printing all the parts and putting it all together with a good
		controlling algorithm. The spiderbot has 4 legs which have a total of 12 servos inside them.</p> <p class="svelte-rhon6"><span class="text-secondary">The circuit</span> starts with a 12.6V Li-Ion battery which goes into
		a DC/DC voltage converter to convert it to 5 Volts. These 5 Volts go into the Arduino Pro board and
		into the 12 MG90S servos. The arduino controls the servos using PWM through it's digital pins.</p> <p class="svelte-rhon6">The Arduino C++ code uses the Servo.h library to control the servos (handles the PWM signal
		generation) and FlexiTimer2 to move smoothly between position interpolation logic.</p> <h2 class="text-primary font-systemancer svelte-rhon6">Work in Progress:</h2> <p class="svelte-rhon6">This is my only project here which is not yet finished.</p> <ul class="ml-10 svelte-rhon6"><li>I am currently working on a custom PCB with the <span class="text-secondary">STM32L412KBT6 microcontroller</span> - just to make it even quicker and special :).
