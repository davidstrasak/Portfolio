	<ol class="ml-10">
		<li>Found my passion for electronics and PCB design</li>
		<li>Creating mobile applications</li>
		<li>Got way better at soldering</li>
		<li>Learned to host a nodeMCU server and control the microcontroller through it</li>
		<li>Learned the importance of state diagrams</li>

	<h2 class="text-primary font-systemancer">Description:</h2>
	<p>
		This project is my Bachelor's thesis where I was tasked with designing an intuitive device which
		controls the movement of conveyors through a mobile app, so mechanical engineers have an easier
		time when commissioning conveyor installation quality (specifically when they are looking if the
		conveyor runs smoothly).
	</p>
	<p>
		I made my own PCB, added in a <span class="text-secondary">WEMOS D1 Mini development board</span
		>
		with an <span class="text-secondary">ESP8266 microcontroller</span>
		unit, wired everything with relays so I am able to switch the control panel inputs to the frequency
		drive and I created the app through which it can all be controlled thanks to a shared WiFi hotspot
		that all the devices are connected to.
	</p>
	<p>
		A cool thing about this project is that <span class="text-secondary"
			>the mobile app not only enables me to control the conveyor</span
		>, but it can have all the instructions for setup and troubleshooting the device and parts of
		the system. And since it's on mobile you do not need any additional devices :D.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was a really interesting challenge with lots of different systems that intertwine into each
		other and it was <span class="text-secondary"
			>my hardest challenge where I was solving the most issues :D.</span
		>
