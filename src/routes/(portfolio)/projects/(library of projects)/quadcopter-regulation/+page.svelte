	<p>
		A quadcopter has 3 torques and 1 thrust that I need to regulate to keep in check 3 angles and 3
		axis that the quadcopter moves in. The thrust represents how quickly the 4 motors spin and the
		torques is represented by the rotation of the quadcopter so it can move not only up and down,
		but also sideways.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="text-secondary">All of these things can be found on the real quadcopter</span> as well
		as my simulation. The only thing omitted from my simulation were external influences like wind.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the regulation, the only way to regulate using a state based regulation like the observer
		is to have the quadcopter in a mode where the angles are really small (because then we can say
		that sines of angles are equal to the angles themselves). Then it was only a matter of
		regulating the thrust and calculating the required angles from the x and y axis differences.
