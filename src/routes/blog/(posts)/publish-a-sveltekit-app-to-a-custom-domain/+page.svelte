<h1 >Publish a static SvelteKit app to a custom domain on github pages</h1>
<p>As you might see, I've recently published a static SvelteKit website (this website). </p>
<p>Which is why I've decided to make this blog post - to document all the steps that you can take in order to have a nice little static SvelteKit website.</p>
<br/>
<h2>But first: for the unitiated: What is SvelteKit?</h2>
<p>It's a web building framework. It allows you to follow a few steps to have websites that are reactive.</p>
<p>For me personally I love SvelteKit, because it is intuitive and it does not require a lot of hoops to jump through (unlike React). Things just make sense</p>
