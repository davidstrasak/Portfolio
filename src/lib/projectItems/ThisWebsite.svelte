		<li>Creating a multi-page website.</li>
		<li>Developing the frontend user experience.</li>
		<li>HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Typescript, SvelteKit, Tailwind, DaisyUI and GitHub.</li>
		<li>Figured out some advanced TS syntax and worked with a lot of objects and components.</li>

	<p>
		I have taken a <span class="text-secondary"
			>full stack development and SvelteKit courses from Udemy</span
		>, so I can develop mechanical engineering web applications at my job as an intern at Honeywell.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thanks to this I've been able to learn enough of web development to <span class="text-secondary"
			>build this website from scratch</span
		>. Not everything was included in the course, but after some time spent googling I was able to
		code everything I've wanted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because this website is hosted on GitHub, it can only be a static website. <span
			class="text-secondary"
			>That means I have to omit the whole backend process of creating a website</span
		>. Luckily I do create backends at my intership, so the knowledge is not completely lost on me.
