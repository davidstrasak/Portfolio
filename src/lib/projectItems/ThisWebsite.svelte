	<h2 class="text-secondary font-bold">Description:</h2>
	<p>
		I have taken a full stack development course, so I can be an intern responsible for mechanical
		engineering related web application my team supports at Honeywell.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thanks to this I've been able to learn enough of web development to build this website from
		scratch. Not everything was included in the course, but once you know the basics, getting to
		know more is just easy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because this website is hosted on GitHub, it can only be a static website. That means I have to
		omit the whole backend process of creating a website - leaving the only tools at my disposal
		here HTML, JS and CSS (Which are definetly enough).
