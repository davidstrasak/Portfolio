        <h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Working with an arduino LED library.</li>
          <li>My first big soldering project.</li>
          <li>Using PWM pins to connect LEDs.</li>
          <li>
            Next time I will solder the cables to the arduino. Not superglue
            them to the pins.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          I've created this vest for the Cybertown event to look like a
          cyberpunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had no idea what I was doing - first time setting up LEDs to
          something like this or painting the vest. One thing about being an
          engineer though, is you realise you can figure stuff out if you think
          about the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code itself is pretty simple - just initialise the LED pins, set
          up the animation and run it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arduino wasn't the best platform for this, because if I had just
          bought a LED strip on aliexpress, it would be easier to do and it
          would last longer. Arduino 9V battery lasted me until the evening of
          the event.
