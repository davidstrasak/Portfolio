        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
          I've been able to take a course on working with embedded systems at
          school. The main curriculum is programming in the C language and
          programming the PIC18F46K22 processor by MicroChip.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole concept of low level programming is interesting to me and I
          will be doing some more when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specific lesson is about using commands to set different
          functions, which control the LEDs (On/Off, Blinking, Continuous,
          Blinking for certain times). The processor is communicating with the
          UART module, which is communicating with the PC through USB.
