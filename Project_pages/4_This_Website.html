        <p>
          I have taken a full stack development course, so I can be an intern
          responsible for mechanical engineering related web application my team
          supports at Honeywell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to this I've been able to learn enough of web development to
          build this website from scratch. Not everything was included in the
          course, but once you know the basics, getting to know more is just
          easy.

          Because this website is hosted on GitHub, it can only be a static
          website. That means I have to omit the whole backend process of
          creating a website - leaving the only tools at my disposal here HTML,
          JS and CSS (Which are definetly enough).
