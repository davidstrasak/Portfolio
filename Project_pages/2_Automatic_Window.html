            It's good to proactively lead school projects, because that means
            someone is leading.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This project was a school project we've completed as a 4 person team.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept is simple - the window opens or closes based on outside
          conditions. The conditions are online weather information, room
          temperature, humidity and time (certain times a day the window opens).
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole project was programmed through MATLAB, so the processor
          itself just had the job of opening and closing the window, while the
          computer was doing the logic behind it.
