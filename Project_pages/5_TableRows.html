        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="width: 100%">
          I've been able to write several tens of thousands lines of VBA code
          thanks to my internship at Honeywell (and an excel VBA course).
        </p>
        <p style="width: 100%">
          While writing these codes, there are some functions that have stood
          the test of time and that I've been using in multiple projects - this
          function is one of those.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 100%">
          The macros I've written are mostly for ease of use, or to update
          calculation tables when new data is added - to make sure calculations
          are correct.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 100%">
          This sub specifically uses the Worksheet_SelectionChange event which
          happens whenever a new cell is selected, data is added, etc. -
          basically any change ever. It tests if the last row of a table is
          full, and if it is, it will add a new row.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 100%">
          In addition to that, this macro copies or deletes the content of the
          cells (which is added with the rows), so the cells have formulas, or
          are empty, where needed.
